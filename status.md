I am not able to get any traffic to show to/from my bulbs, however they do connect to my wifi and declare themselves to the router as Sengled Bulbs.

### Currently
I am trying to review the SSL certs for all IPs on the Sengled servers and to verify their state. I have seen reports that you can us Home Automation to bypass cert issues.
